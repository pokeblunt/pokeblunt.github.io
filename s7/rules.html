    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>We generally follow Smogon's Gen 9 Doubles OU rules. In a season, we play several tournaments and then playoffs are held at the end of each season.</p>
    <h4>Draft rules</h4>
    <p>The draft pick order is reverse order of placement for last season with any newcomers going first. Players iteratively choose pokemon for their roster in a snake draft, meaning every even round is picked in reverse order (ex: 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 ...). A pokemon is defined by their national dex number. For example, if you pick pokemon No. 38 (Ninetails) then you get Kanto Ninetails and Alolan Ninetails. Pokemon from the same evolutionary line can belong to different players.</p>
    <h4>Battle rules</h4>
    <p>Use Smogon's Gen 9 (Scarlet & Violet) <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/sv/formats/doubles/" target="_blank">Gen 9 Double OU rules</a> with the following additions and exceptions:</p>

    <h4>Tournament rules</h4>
    <p>Use the following rules for each tournament:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Four players participate in each tournament.</li>
        <li>Each participant chooses a team of 6 pokemon to use for the entire tournament.</li>
        <li>Each participant plays all other players in the tournament exactly once.</li>
        <li>The player who won the most battles wins the tournament. If two or more players are tied with the most wins, all other players are eliminated and the remaining players repeat steps 2 and 3.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Season rules</h4>
    <p>Tournaments consist of 4 players and there are 15 tournaments this season (one for every combination of 4 players). This means each player will participate in 10 tournaments for a total of at least 30 matches.</p>
    <p>All players advance to the playoffs. Players are ranked by tournament wins and then number of match wins if tied. If still tied, play single matches to determine an order.</p>
    <h4>Playoff rules</h4>
    <p>Players can use different pokemon for each match even within one playoff round. Seed a 6 person single elimination bracket (top 2 players get byes). The first round is best 2 out of 3. The semi-finals are best 3 out of 5. The finals and 3rd vs 4th place match are best 4 our of 7. The champion of the finals wins the season and picks their MVP (Most Valuable Pokemon) for the season.</p>

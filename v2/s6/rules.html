    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>We generally follow Smogon's Gen 8 Doubles OU rules. In a season, we play several tournaments and then playoffs are held at the end of each season.</p>
    <h4>Draft rules</h4>
    <p>The draft pick order is determined by an unofficial tournament at the start of the season. Players iteratively choose pokemon for their roster in a snake draft, meaning every even round is picked in reverse order (ex: 1 2 3 4 5 5 4 3 2 1 1 2 ...). Each pokemon (along with associated forms and megas) can only be on one player's roster. Pokemon from the same evolutionary line can belong to different players.</p>
    <h4>Battle rules</h4>
    <p>Use Smogon's Gen 8 (Sword & Shield) <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/ss/formats/doubles/" target="_blank">Gen 8 Double OU rules</a> with the following additions and exceptions:</p>

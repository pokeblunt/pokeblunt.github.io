    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <p>We generally follow Smogon's Doubles OU rules and play several tournaments where each player participates each season. Playoffs are held at the end of each season.</p>
    <h4>Draft rules</h4>
    <p>The draft pick order is determined by an unofficial tournament at the start of the season. Players iteratively choose pokemon for their roster in a snake draft, meaning every even round is picked in reverse order (ex: 1 2 3 4 4 3 2 1 1 2 ...). Each pokemon (along with associated forms and megas) can only be on one player's roster. Pokemon from the same evolutionary line can belong to different players.</p>
    <h4>Battle rules</h4>
    <p>Use Smogon's Gen 7 (Sun and Moon) <a href="https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/formats/doubles/" target="_blank">Double OU rules</a> with the following additions and exceptions:</p>

    <h4>Tournament rules</h4>
    <p>Use the following rules for each tournament:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Each player chooses a team of 6 pokemon to use the entire tournament.</li>
        <li>Each player plays all other players exactly once.</li>
        <li>The player who won the most battles wins the tournament. If two or more players are tied with the most wins, all other players are eliminated and the remaining players repeat steps 2 and 3.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Season rules</h4>
    <p>Players play 10 tournaments. All players advance to the playoffs. Players are ranked by tournament wins and then number of match wins if tied. If still tied, play single matches to determine an order.</p>
    <h4>Playoff rules</h4>
    <p>Players can use different pokemon for each battle. The bottom two players play a best 2 out of 3 and the winner advances. That player plays the next worse player in a best 2 out of 3 and this continues until the championship. The championship is a best 3 out of 5. The champion wins the season and picks their MVP (Most Valuable Pokemon) for the season.</p>

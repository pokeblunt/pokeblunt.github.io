    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <h4>Draft rules</h4>
    <p>The draft pick order is reverse order of placement for last season. Players iteratively choose pokemon for their roster in a regular rotation (ex: 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 ...). A pokemon is defined by their national dex number. For example, if you pick pokemon No. 38 (Ninetails) then you get Kanto Ninetails and Alolan Ninetails. Pokemon from the same evolutionary line can belong to different players.</p>

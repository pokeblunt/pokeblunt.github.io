    <h4>Tournament rules</h4>
    <p>Use the following rules for each tournament:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Each player chooses a team of 6 pokemon to use the entire tournament.</li>
        <li>Each player plays all other players twice.</li>

    </ol>
    <h4>Season rules</h4>
    <p>Players play 14 tournaments. The top two players advance to the championship. Players are ranked by tournament wins and then number of matches won if tied. If still tied, play single matches to determine an order. The championship is a best 3 out of 5. The champion wins the season and picks their MVP (Most Valuable Pokemon) for the season.</p>
